abstract = {Developing Non-Player Characters, i.e., game characters that interact with the game’s environment autonomously with flexibility to experiment different behavior configurations is not a trivial task. Traditionally, this has been done with techniques that limit the complexity of the behavior of Non-Player Characters (NPCs), as in the case of using Navigation Mesh (NavMesh) for navigation behaviors. For this problem, it has been shown that reinforcement learning can be more efficient and flexible than traditional techniques. However, integrating reinforcement learning into current game development tools is laborious, given that a great deal of experimentation and coding is required. For that, we have developed a modeling environment that integrates with a game development tool and allows the direct specification of reward functions and NPC agent components with maximum code reuse and automatic code generation.}

abstract = {Humans and animals learn much better when the examples are not randomly presented but organized in a meaningful order which illustrates gradually more concepts, and gradually more complex ones. Here, we formalize such training strategies in the context of machine learning, and call them "curriculum learning". In the context of recent research studying the difficulty of training in the presence of non-convex training criteria (for deep deterministic and stochastic neural networks), we explore curriculum learning in various set-ups. The experiments show that significant improvements in generalization can be achieved. We hypothesize that curriculum learning has both an effect on the speed of convergence of the training process to a minimum and, in the case of non-convex criteria, on the quality of the local minima obtained: curriculum learning can be seen as a particular form of continuation method (a general strategy for global optimization of non-convex functions).},
